# BankerAlgorithmJavaGui
Banker's Algorithm is a Java program that implements the Banker's algorithm, which is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems.

Description
The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting the number of processes, resources, allocation, max need, and available resources. It allows users to add processes and resources dynamically and make resource requests. The program uses the Banker's algorithm to check the safety of the resource allocation and grant or deny the requests accordingly.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed
How to Run
Compile the Java source file:

Copy code
javac BankersAlgorithm.java
Run the program:

Copy code
java BankersAlgorithm
Usage
Enter the number of processes and resources in the input fields.

Click the "Add" button to add the allocation, max need, and available resources input fields.

Enter the values for the allocation, max need, and available resources in the corresponding input fields.

To make a resource request, enter the requested resources in the request input fields and click the "Request" button.

The program will display whether the request is granted or denied based on the Banker's algorithm.
